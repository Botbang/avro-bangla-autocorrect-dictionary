# avro-bangla-autocorrect-dictionary
The built in autocorrect dictionary in avro Bangla keyboard doesn't contain enough word. So, this is my approach to enrich the dictionary. This file contains the correct spelling of commonly used Bangla words. 

<h2>To use the Dictionary file</h2>
<b>First: right click on avro icon 
then go to: tools > Avro Phonetic Options > Edit/Import Autocorrect Entries</b>

Then 
<b>click on Import. Then select the autodict.dct file</b>

and you should be good to go.

Enjoy!
